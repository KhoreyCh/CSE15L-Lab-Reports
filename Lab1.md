## CD command
In this first week we learned about different commands that you can use in the terminal. Most of these had to do with interacting with files and directories. The first command we learned was the cd command which is short for "change directory". This allows us to go into a different folder (in a way). This will require an argument which would be the directory that we are switching to. It can be either an absolute or relative path. You can use this command with:
`ls [argument]`

Here's an example of me using this command. I started at the kernel and changed directories to lecture1
